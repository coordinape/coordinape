Always ask before making any git commits or changes to remotes.

Our git workflow is: 
- create a new branch of main
- stage your changes with git
- test your changes with `pnpm typescript` and format with `pnpm lint-staged`
- commit the changes,
- push the branch to `origin` and create a pull request. You can use Github CLI (gh) to create the PRs.
