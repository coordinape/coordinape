# Cypress Setup Path

- [x] install cypress
- [x] set up an auto-signing web3 provider that works well with the test chain
- [x] create a static seed that covers all use cases and patterns
- [x] set up a more advanced test script to showcase cypress' functionality
- [x] configure a docker-compose file that doesn't clobber the dev container setup
